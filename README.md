# DQN-vs-NEAT-Tetris
This is source code for our comparison of the proffeciency of NEAT vs DQN at Tetris. It includes weights from training each model through 36,000 games extracted every 500 games. The analysis of our data is kept in a seperate folder from the models, their environments and scripts to asses them.
To see our very best model play, open the DQN folder and run the RenderGame script with the model 'Backup30500'. Enjoy:)
